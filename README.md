# Gamgee

An embedded framework to lend you a helping durable execution hand on your journey.

![Build Status](https://github.com/omervk/gamgee/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

## Philosophy

<img src="./resources/tradeoffs.jpg" width="256" height="auto" />

This is being built to be lightweight, testable, localized/embedded and as type safe as I can make it, with a visual and single source of truth for how the workflow is built.

Workers should expect an influx of requests, and itâ€™s preferable they be persistent and durable (can get an item, work on it, get the next item, etc.). Steps/tasks should be a single(?) idempotent IO call. The classic use case is when you have a streaming-like business flow, but a streaming framework like Kafka Streams is overkill.
